# Performance TODOs

1. Implement code splitting and lazy loading for route-based components
2. Optimize images and other assets
3. Implement memoization for expensive computations
4. Use React.memo for pure functional components
5. Implement virtualization for long lists (e.g., transaction history)
6. Optimize Web3 calls by batching requests where possible
7. Implement caching for frequently accessed data
8. Use service workers for offline support and faster load times
9. Optimize CSS by removing unused styles and minimizing CSS-in-JS usage
10. Implement performance monitoring and set up alerts for performance regressions
